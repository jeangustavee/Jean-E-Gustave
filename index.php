				<b>Identity.</b> It’s very challenging to define what I am. Although I’m more comfortable in a UI/UX designer/art director’s shoes, other creative entities don’t cease to invade my intellect. My persona is what separates me from others. Rather than pursuing dough, advancing status, winning awards, I prefer to create and work on project I enjoy doing, keep challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

				<b>Who I become?</b> I spoil my appetite on simple interfaces. I also love coding and illustration. Like all Haitian people I live off patriotic pride, I eat spicy and rice & bean every day! I also say “Sak pase? to greet my friends. I graduated from Florida State College at Jacksonville with a major in Digital Multimedia Technology and a minor in Graphic Design Production.

			<p>
				<b>Now.</b> Currently, I am an Art Director and Partner at <a href="http://anteanstudios.com" target="_blank">ANTEAN STUDIOS</a> where I work for great clients and collaborate with amazing artists. When I’m not at Antean Studios loosing my mind, you may find me doing shows or pushing on with <a href="http://viiatours.com" target="_blank"> VIIA TOURS</a> or <a href="http://citiskope.com">CitiSkope</a>.

				<b>What’s next?</b> If you would like to work with me or would like to collaborate, <a href="">send me an email</a> or contact my agent <a href="http://topkreyol.com/jeanegustave">TopKreyol</a>. Don't you think we could change the world?.
